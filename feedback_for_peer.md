# Feedback for David's repository - 21 Feb

### Revise
Quiz images could be compiled in md files instead of pngs for ease of readeability (currently no way to rescale image to see full picture, and code in text form may be potentially useful for future editing/revising.)

### Clarifying Question
None

### Add
When available, add Quiz 33 (currently unable to access instructions on learning log for Quiz 33)

### Remove
None
